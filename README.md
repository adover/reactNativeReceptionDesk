# React Native Reception Desk Application
### Built by Dover
This is a first attempt at making a React Native application. I've decided to keep it relatively simple, at the same time making sure it achieves what I need to do. As I'm keen to help you guys develop your skills I've also documented as much as possible, so to serve to increase your understanding of some of the fundamentals. 

**If you're going to do anything with this, please take a fork and work on it yourself!**

## To Run
`React-native run-ios`
`React-native run-android`

## To Log to CMD Line
`React-native log-ios`
`React-native log-android`

Debugger: http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui - Enable debugging from Simulator, make sure it's enabled in the simulator by pressing `cmd + d`

## Redux
I've decided to use Redux in this implementation but went without ImmutableJS. To me it seems to overcomplicate things which are actually really simple.
